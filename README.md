* Push Docker image to Docker Hub
* Deploy to Kubernetes cluster

### Example `Jenkinsfile` snippet:

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  environment {
    DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('docker-hub-credentials')
    IMAGE_NAME = 'batoolsh2001/my-react-app'
  }

  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git branch: 'main', credentialsId: 'github-pat', url: 'https://github.com/batooldshilleh/football-front.git'
      }
    }
    stage('Build Docker Image') {
      steps {
        sh 'docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME .'
      }
    }
    stage('Push to Docker Hub') {
      steps {
        script {
          sh 'echo $DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS_PSW | docker login -u $DOCKER_HUB_CREDENTIALS_USR --password-stdin'
          sh 'docker push $IMAGE_NAME'
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
      steps {
        withCredentials([file(credentialsId: 'kubeconfig-minikube', variable: 'KUBECONFIG')]) {
          sh 'kubectl --kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG apply -f frontend-deployment.yaml'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
